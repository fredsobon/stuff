A class is made up of Puppet resources.
->> True

Defining a class automatically includes the class in your configuration.
->> False

In the following example, how many resources are being defined?

class ssh { 
  package { 'openssh-clients': 
      ensure => present, 
  }
  file { '/etc/ssh/ssh_config': 
     ensure => file,
     owner => 'root',
     group => 'root',
     source => 'puppet:///modules/ssh/ssh_config',
  } 
   service { 'sshd': 
     ensure => running, 
      enable => true,
  }
}

->> 3

In the following example, what is the title of the class? 
class ssh {
  package { 'openssh-clients':
     ensure => present,
  }
  file { '/etc/ssh/ssh_config':
     ensure => file,
     owner => 'root',
     group => 'root',
     source => 'puppet:///modules/ssh/ssh_config',
  }
  service { 'sshd':
     ensure => running,
     enable => true,
  }
}

->> ssh

Puppet classes are reusable and singleton.
True

exercice : 

1. Create a new manifest file called motd.pp:

vim motd.pp

2. In that file create a class named motd that will manage the /etc/motd file in a given state.

3. The file resource that your class contains might look similar to:

file { '/etc/motd':
  ensure  => file,
  owner   => 'root',
  group   => 'root',
  content => 'Hello world! Puppet is awesome.',
}
4. Run puppet parser validate motd.pp to validate your syntax.

5. Apply your manifest with puppet apply motd.pp. Notice that no changes were made. Why is that?

6.Add the line include motd to the end of your manifest and apply it again. Can you explain why you saw the results you did?


[root@animas-declo /]# cat motd.pp 
class motd {
  file { '/etc/motd':
    ensure  => file, 
    owner   => 'root',
    group   => 'root',
    content => 'Hello World, puppet is awesome',
  }
}

[root@animas-declo /]# puppet parser validate motd.pp
[root@animas-declo /]# puppet apply motd.pp
Notice: Compiled catalog for animas-declo.try.puppet.com in environment production in 0.08 seconds
Notice: Applied catalog in 0.02 seconds
[root@animas-declo /]# cat /etc/motd 

Adding the class ..after the class declaration make it available and call it  :

[root@animas-declo /]# cat  motd.pp 
class motd {
  file { '/etc/motd':
    ensure  => file, 
    owner   => 'root',
    group   => 'root',
    content => 'Hello World, puppet is awesome',
  }
}
include motd

[root@animas-declo /]# puppet apply motd.pp
Notice: Compiled catalog for animas-declo.try.puppet.com in environment production in 0.08 seconds
Notice: /Stage[main]/Motd/File[/etc/motd]/content: content changed '{md5}d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e' to '{md5}6c9a9d222cc8307074832d66dc61aa28'
Notice: Applied catalog in 0.04 seconds
[root@animas-declo /]# cat /etc/motd
Hello World, puppet is awesome[root@animas-declo /]# vim motd.pp 




/!\ A class can only called once for a node !!!!
