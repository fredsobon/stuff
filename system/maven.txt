Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Maven can manage a project’s build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information. This tutorial will help you to install Apache Maven on your CentOS/RHEL 7/6/5 and Fedora 25/24.

Install Apache Maven


=== Step 1 – Install Java

Java development kit is the primary requirement of Apache Maven. So you need to install Java development kit (JDK) on your system. Make sure you have installed JDK, not JRE.

$ java -version 

java version "1.8.0_121"
ava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_121-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.121-b13, mixed mode, sharing)

If you don’t have Java Development Kit installed on your system. Visit install Java 8 on CentOS/RHEL 7/6/5


=== Step 2 – Install Apache Maven

After verifying java version on you system. Download Apache maven from its official website or use following command to download Apache Maven 3.3.9.

$ cd /opt
$ wget http://www-eu.apache.org/dist/maven/maven-3/3.3.9/binaries/apache-maven-3.3.9-bin.tar.gz

Now extract downloaded archive using following command.

$ sudo tar xzf apache-maven-3.3.9-bin.tar.gz
$ sudo ln -s apache-maven-3.3.9 maven

=== Step 3 – Setup Environment Variables

As you have downloaded pre compiled Apache Maven files on your system. Now set the environments variables by creating new file /etc/profile.d/maven.sh.

$ sudo vi /etc/profile.d/maven.sh

and add following content.

export M2_HOME=/opt/maven
export PATH=${M2_HOME}/bin:${PATH}

Now load the environment variables in current shell using following command.

$ source /etc/profile.d/maven.sh


== Step 4 – Check Version

Apache Maven has been successfully configured on your system. Use following command to check version of Maven.

$ mvn -version
