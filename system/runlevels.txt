System V scripts
Most Linux-based operating systems to date use a System-V style init daemon. In other
words, their startup process is managed by a daemon called init, which functions in a
way that is inherited from the old System V Unix-based operating system.
This daemon functions on the principle of runlevels, which represent the state of the
computer. Here is a table representing the various runlevels and their signification:
                  Runlevel      State
                  0             System is halted
                  1             Single-user mode (rescue mode)
                  2             Multiuser mode, without NFS support
                  3             Full multiuser mode
                  4             Not used
                  5             Graphical interface mode
                  6             System reboot
You can manually initiate a runlevel transition: use the telinit 0 command to
shut down your computer or telinit 6 to reboot it.


Debian-based distributions
For the former, a simple command will enable the init script for the system runlevel:

[root@example.com ~]# update-rc.d -f nginx defaults

This command will create links in the default system runlevel folders. For the
reboot and shutdown runlevels, the script will be executed with the stop argument;
for all other runlevels, the script will be executed with start. You can now restart
your system and see your Nginx service being launched during the boot sequence.

Red Hat-based distributions
For the Red Hat-based systems family, the command differs, but you get an
additional tool for managing system startup. Adding the service can be done via the
following command:
[root@example.com ~]# chkconfig nginx on
Once that is done, you can then verify the runlevels for the service:
[root@example.com ~]# chkconfig --list nginx
Nginx     0:off    1:off     2:on      3:off     4:on     5:on     6:off
