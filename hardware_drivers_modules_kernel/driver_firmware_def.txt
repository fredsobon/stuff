===  notes sur firmware and driver ===


Firmware is the lowest level of software that interacts with the hardware. Think of it as piece of code embedded and permanent for that hardware; which nowadays is flashed in memory and can be updated.

Firmware could be single assembly and/or C program or for complex and bigger systems it comprises of bootloaders (BIOS, Uboot, UBL), Embedded OS and filesystems. Router, DVR, memory cards, pen drive, smart TV all have firmware code.

Device driver is part of operating system, specific to any hardware. Device driver also interacts with user space application.

For embedded devices running OS, device drivers are considered as part of firmware (something which product vendor supplies).
