===== network supervision short resume ===
Related to quick quizz answers from mooc network supervision 

= Main concepts = 

What is the main task of network monitoring?
-> Collecting information about the network state Collecting information about the network state 


Which institution takes an important role in the standardization of network management? 
-> IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)

What does the FCAPS accronym mean (which summarizes the functional areas of network management)? 
-> ￼Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, Security


What is challenging in fault management?
-> to identify the root cause of the fault
-> to quickly react when the fault happens

 Which one of the following metrics is not a performance indicator in network management?
-> number of managed components


What is accounting in network management
->counting network usage

Why is network management essential in today's networking?

->networks are larger
->networks are more complex (many types of equipments, protocols, etc.)
->networks support more critical services


= Key Concepts with SNMP =

= managment system information architecture : 

What are the roles of a Network Management Entity?
-> Collect, store management data
-> Transmit data to the manager
-> Answer to commands from the manager

What are the roles of a Network Management Application? 
-> Propose a powerful management interface to operators
-> Retrieve management information
-> Send commands to the managed devices

What is an agent? 
-> Process implementing management primitives on a device
-> By extension, a managed device

What are the advantages of a polling strategy over event reporting? 
-> More reliable
-> ￼ Less complicated for agents

How to formulate the availability of a system?
-> MTBF/(MTBF+MTTR) : maximum time between failure / (maximum time between failure + maximum time to repair)

In the case of a managed device/service interacting in real time with users, what metric is the most important? 
-> Response Time Response Time 

When collecting management information, what are the advantages of sampling compared to exhaustive measurements?
-> Reduced load on the agent
->  Reduced bandwith usage


= managment information :

How is structured Management Information? (SMI)
-> Written in ASN.1, following SMI standard, organized in a tree

What is a Management Information Base?
->  An entity that defines variables to be modified or monitored for a given managed device 

What are the difference between a Gauge32 and a Counter32 as SMI's scalar types? The answer can also be found in the following RFC: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2578#section-7.1.6
-> Counter32 can overflow when Gauge32 cannot
-> Gauge32 can decrease when Counter32 cannot

What is true about SMI Naming Tree?
-> Leaves are managed object Ids
-> Every standardized MIB has a place in the tree

When defining an Object Type, what does "SYNTAX SEQUENCE OF X" mean? 
->  A list of 1..N objects of type X 

What is the naming pattern in SMI to access a data defined in a table?
-> OID_of_Table.Column_number.Index_value 

What define the following lines of code? (NA=1)

SYNTAX type
MAX-ACCESS read-write
STATUS current
DESCRIPTION "textual description"
::{OBJECT IDENTIFIER}

-> A new type of management information 


= overview of snmp :

What does SNMP stand for? 
-> Simple Network Management Protocol

What are IETF's design choices behind the first version of SNMP?
-> Should be simple
-> Should transport simple scalar values

What is the transport protocol under SNMP? 
-> UDP

What primitives are not supported by SNMP?
-> Delete 


What primitives are supported by SNMP?
-> get
-> set 
-> trap

What is the main limitation of the TRAP operation in SNMPv1 that was corrected in SNMPv2?
-> the notification is not acknowledged and can get lost


What are the two main improvements of SNMPv3 over SNMPv2?
-> security (encrypted traffic)
-> evolutivity (possible extensions)


What field in the SNMP PDU allows to link a response with the corresponding request? 
-> ResquestID 

= Exemples & tools :

In which component of a Network Management architecture lies the intelligence? 
->  Management Application

What is true about RMON? 
-> It is standardized by IETF
-> It relies on its own general-purpose MIB

What does contain the Net-SNMP tool suite? 
-> Command-line executables
-> A graphical MIB browser
-> SNMP agents
-> C library to develop SNMP applications

What commands from Net-SNMP allow to explore a MIB? 
-> snmpgetnext
-> snmpwalk

What features does Centreon implement?

The CoffeePot.mib specification defines a series of fictitious OID nodes in order to avoid collisions with existing MIBs.
-> 1.3.6.1.4.1 is the standard OID prefix for PRIVATE nodes
-> 1.3.6.1.4.1.domestic is a fictitious node.
-> 1.3.6.1.4.1.domestic.householdElectricals designates a fictitious node for all electric machines at home.
-> All OIDs of the coffee pot MIB will begin with 1.3.6.1.4.1.9999.1.2
