- numerotation de ports : 
When switches are stacked or for ports in a chassis, ports are identified by module:port, such as
1:1, 2:24 and so on.

You can use lists of ports separated by commas: 1,17,23 or 1:1,2:27,3:23.

You can use port ranges: 1-12 or 4:4-4:14. In the latter case, this also works:4:4-14. 
You can also
mix the lists and ranges: 1-4,23 or 4:4-14,5:7.

= Using VLANs


ExtremeXOS is very VLAN-centric. Unlike port-based operating systems, most of the configuration
takes place at the VLAN level. VLANs are created, then given IP addresses, ports, 802.1Q tag values,
and QoS settings. In short, the VLAN must be created first and then configured.
Once the VLAN is created, you refer to it directly by name when you give it an IP address, add ports to
it, etc. In fact, the VLAN name is mandatory and (in most cases), but the vlan keyword is optional.

-Creating a VLAN
A newly created VLAN has no member ports, is untagged, and uses protocol filter any until you
configure it otherwise. In ExtremeXOS, VLANs are usually given descriptive names like “data” or “voice”
or “wireless” instead of “vlan2100”.

Examples:
create vlan Data
create vlan Voice
Port Tagging and VLAN

In ExtremeXOS, there are tagged ports and untagged ports. A tagged port will send and receive 802.1Q
tagged packets to or from a specific VLAN. An untagged port will send untagged traffic to or from a
specific VLAN.
You can choose from one of the following options:
• Untagged Ports — Because there’s no way to distinguish between VLANs when using untagged
traffic, a port can be assigned as an untagged port to only one VLAN at a time. If you want
untagged traffic to go to a different VLAN, you have to delete the port from the old VLAN before
you can add it to the new one as an untagged port. If you do not specify whether the port should be
added as tagged or untagged, untagged is assumed.
• Tagged Ports — Because traffic can be distinguished based on the 802.1Q tag value, a port can be
assigned as tagged to multiple VLANs at a time. The 802.1Q tag value assigned to the VLAN
determines which tag value is used.
• Mixing Tagged and Untagged Traffic — ExtremeXOS fully supports mixing tagged and untagged
traffic. A port can be an untagged member of one VLAN and a tagged member of several other
VLANs simultaneously.

Examples:
#add untagged ports to a VLAN
config Data add port 1-12
#add tagged ports on module 1 to a stacked switch or chassis
config Data add port 2:45-48 tag

Assigning an IP Address to a VLAN
You can use dotted decimal subnets or CIDR notation when specifying subnets. If no subnet mask is
specified, the “natural mask” is assumed.

Example: # dotted decimal subnet notation
config vlan Data ipaddress 10.1.10.1 255.255.255.0
Example: # CIDR subnet syntax and abbreviations
conf Voice ipa 10.1.20.1/24

Assigning an 802.1Q Tag value to the VLAN
To assign the 802.1Q tag value to the VLAN, follow the syntax of this example:
config Data tag 10

About Assigning a QoS Profile to a VLAN
Fully explaining Quality of Service (QoS) is out of scope for this document, but is discussed in depth in
the ExtremeXOS User Guide. However, one thing to note is that when SummitStack switches are
actually stacked together, QP7 (802.1p bit value of 6) is reserved by the stack for stacking control
traffic. You will not be able to use QP7 in your stacks.
QoS Profiles QP1 and QP8 are always available. QP2 – QP7 must be created before they can be used.
Example:
create qos QP6
config Voice qosprofile QP6


= Show VLAN Commands

Command Description
show vlan Shows you most of what you need to know regarding all of your VLANs,
including IP addresses, the VLAN ID (802.1Q tag), how many ports are in the
VLAN, and a wealth of other information shown with a series of flags.
show vlan vlan name Shows more detailed information on a specific VLAN. Because the vlan
keyword is usually optional, you can just use show vlan name.

Example:
This example shows that the “Voice” vlan is configured to route (IP Forwarding Enabled), has OSPF
enabled, and is protected by an EAPS ring.

- vlan 

create vlan :

-> Extreme Networks utilizes XOS as their network operating system. It is a Linux-based OS with some pretty handy features. XOS uses a tag and untag syntax similar to the HP's Procurve line :

create vlan finance
configure "finance" tag 87

-> creation of the VLAN name along with the 802.1q tag of 87 was easy. Next, we want to add a few ports the finance VLAN, and add it to a trunk so we can pass finance VLAN traffic between other switches. First, we will remove some ports from the default VLAN for use in the finance VLAN. XOS will not let you add an untagged port more than 1 VLAN:

* Core_2.11 # configure "Default" delete ports 7:5-7:7
* Core_2.12 # configure "finance" add ports 7:5-7:7 untagged
* Core_2.13 # configure "finance" add ports 5:1 tagged
Make sure finance is protected by EAPS. Adding EAPS ring ports to a VLAN could cause a loop in the network.
Do you really want to add these ports? (y/N) Yes

As you can see, we removed 3 ports from the default vlan (7:5, 7:6, and 7:7) and added them to the finance VLAN. Notice that I specified untagged at the end of the command. This is not required, as XOS will add ports as untagged by default unless you specify them as tagged ports. However, it's a good habit to specify your tagged and untagged ports. If you have not assigned finance to an EAP ring you will the warning above. It is fine to say yes. 

I assigned port 5:1 as the tagged port (trunk port), but remember to tag the other end of that port as well. You must have the finance VLAN created and tagged on the other device in order for Core_2 to pass vlan 87 network data. 








== Extreme Xos quick guide : 

= Port Numbering
In standalone switches (not stacked, not in a chassis), ports are identified by their number, such as 1,
2, 3, 4 and so on.
When switches are stacked or for ports in a chassis, ports are identified by module:port, such as
1:1, 2:24 and so on.
You can use lists of ports separated by commas: 1,17,23 or 1:1,2:27,3:23.
You can use port ranges: 1-12 or 4:4-4:14. In the latter case, this also works:4:4-14. You can also
mix the lists and ranges: 1-4,23 or 4:4-14,5:7.

= System-Level Components
ExtremeXOS switches store two versions of code in non-volatile RAM. The two versions are called
Primary and Secondary, but that does not mean that Primary is tried first and if it fails to work then
Secondary is tried. Primary and Secondary are just names. The show switch command lets you see
what versions of software are loaded into the switch, version the switch is running on (Image Booted),
and what version will be loaded the next time the switch boots (Image Selected).

Loading New Software

ExtremeXOS does not let you replace your booted version. So if you booted on the secondary image,
you can only load new code into the primary image slot. ExtremeXOS handles the slot selection for you
automatically.
Set up a TFTP server with the new software and then load it onto the switch using this command:
download image tftp server IP address image name vr vr-default

Example: download image 192.168.0.0 summitX-12.6.1.3.xos vr vr-default

Note
Unless you are actually using the management port, you must include vr vr-default at
the end of the command.

Loading New Bootrom Code
On very rare occasions, you might need to load new bootrom code onto the switch before you run new
software. Check the Release Notes to see if your current bootrom code is compatible. Only download a
new bootrom if it is required.

1 To download a new bootrom, run this command:
download bootrom 192.168.0.0 pmon_summitl-1.0.5.6.xtr vr vr-default

2 Select the next image to be booted using either of these commands, depending on which partition
you want to boot to:
use image primary
use image secondary
3 Reboot using the reboot command.

Uploading Config Files to a TFTP Server
Resetting a Switch to the Factory Defaults
Show Configuration Commands
These commands let you view configuration settings.
Command Description
show config Shows the currently running configuration.
show config detail The default configuration settings are suppressed. This
command lets you see these settings.
show config module Shows the configuration for a particular module, such
as VLAN, IP, EAPS, OSPF, and so on.
Example: Show OSPF configuration
show config ospf
Changing the CLI Paging
By default, the CLI shows you a page of 25 lines at a time and then waits for you to press a key to
continue. You can turn off the page-by-page display when you want to view larger amounts of data, for
example, when you have set your terminal program to capture the output to a log file.

1 To turn off the page-by-page display, run this command:
disable clipaging

2 To turn the paging feature back on, run this command:
enable clipaging

Save Configuraton Commands

Command Description
save config Writes the current config to whatever file name is specified in “Config
selected”.
save config filename Writes the current config to a new file name, and then asks if you want to
make the new file the default database by returing this message:
Do you want to select this file for booting?
Note
Do not add the .cfg extension to the file name, ExtremeXOS automatically adds the extension
for you.
Example: Save the configuration to a new file name

#save config test
Do you want to save configuration to test.cfg? (y/N) Yes
Saving configuration on master ............. done!
Configuration saved to test.cfg successfully.

The current selected default configuration database to boot up the system
(primary.cfg) is different than the one just saved (test.cfg).
Do you want to make test.cfg the default database? (y/N) No
Default configuration database selection cancelled.

Backing Up Config Files on a TFTP Server
You can back up config files to or from a TFTP server.

Command Description
tftp put tftp address vr vr-default config file Writes a file to a TFTP server.
tftp get tftp address vr vr-default config file Copies a file from a TFTP server.
Example:
tftp put 192.168.1.1 vr vr-default test.cfg
Note

You do not specify the .cfg extension when saving files, but you must specify .cfg when
using TFTP.
Uploading Config Files to a TFTP Server
You can copy a configuration from one switch to other switches by uploading the configuration file
from the TFTP server and letting configuration happen automatically.

ExtremeXOS config files are stored as XML, which can be hard for us humans to read. ExtremeXOS and
Ridgeline identify normal ASCII files with an extension of .xsf.
• To upload the config in ASCII format, run this command:
upload configuration tftp address remote name vr vr-default
Example:
upload configuration 192.168.1.1 newscript.xsf vr vr-default
Note
Because there is no download configuration command, use tftp get to copy an .xsf file
back down to the switch.

Resetting a Switch to the Factory Defaults
You can reset the configuration of a switch to the factory defaults using one of the following
commands. Neither command affects the license levels or the stacking mode of a switch.

Command Description
unconfigure switch Resets the configuration back to factory defaults except for the
odometer, clock, and user accounts and passwords.
unconfigure switch all Resets the configuration back to factory defaults, including user
accounts and passwords.

show port 3:4,3:7 utilization packets
show port 17 utilization bytes

-Monitoring QoS Behavior

This command lets you view the QoS behavior for a port.
Example:
show port 1 qosmonitor no-refresh

Note
You can only monitor one port from each SummitStack or BD8K module at a time.


-Enabling and Disabling Link Aggregation
These commands let you enable and disable link aggregation. Link Aggregation (LAG) is the standard
industry term for what Cisco calls EtherChannel and Avaya calls MultiLinkTrunking.

Command Description
enable sharing master port grouping port list Enables sharing.
disable sharing master port Disables sharing.
Examples: Enabling link aggregation sharing
enable sharing 1 grouping 1-2
enable sharing 5:3 grouping 5:3-5:4, 6:3-6:4
enable sharing 1

- Using LACP with Link Aggregation
The Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) brings several advantages to Link Aggregation, some of
which include:
• Much better visibility into the LAG partner switch.
• Add and delete ports without tearing down the whole LAG.
• LAGs recover from port failures faster with LACP.
• Can only be added to a LAG when the LAG is built.
• If you create a LAG without LACP and later decide you want to add it, you have to tear down the
LAG and then rebuild it using LACP.
To use LACP with a LAG, simply add the lacp keyword at the end of the enable sharing command.
Using Ports

Examples:
enable sharing 1 grouping 1-2 lacp
enable sharing 5:3 grouping 5:3-5:4, 6:3-6:4 lacp
Note
LACP must be enabled on both ends before the LAG will come up. If LACP is enabled on one
end and not the other, the ports on the LACP will never be operational. So either both ends
are enabled or neither are.

-Show IP Routing Commands
The following commands are commonly used for performing IP routing operations.
Command Description
show iproute Shows the IP route table. iproute is all one word in
ExtremeXOS.
show ipconfig Shows the IP interfaces on the switch. ipconfig is all one
word in ExtremeXOS.

show iparp
show iparp vlan name
show iparp ipaddress
show iparp macaddress
Shows the IP ARP cache. iparp is all one word in
ExtremeXOS.
clear iparp
clear iparp vlan name
clear iparp ipaddress
Clears the IP ARP cache.


-Enabling Routing
In ExtremeXOS, you must do two things before you route to or from a VLAN:
• Give the VLAN an IP address.
• Enable IP forwarding.
If you only give the VLAN an IP address, you can ping the interface, Telnet to it, point your web browser
at it, but the switch will not route on that VLAN.
Just because you can ping a VLAN does not mean that VLAN has IP forwarding enabled. An
ExtremeXOS switch will respond to a ping to any of its IP addresses regardless of the IP forwarding
state.
1 To turn on routing on a VLAN:
enable ipforwarding [vlan] vlan name
ExtremeXOS Quick Guide 24
2 To turn on ipforwarding on all of the VLANs at once:
enable ipforwarding
Note
If you enable IP forwarding and then later add a VLAN, IP forwarding will not be enabled
on the new VLAN. You must add an IP address and then turn on IP forwarding for the
VLAN.

-Configuring Static and Default IP Routes
Command Description
config iproute add subnet/mask next hop gateway Configures a static IP route.
config iproute add default next hop gateway Configures a default IP route.
Example: Configure static IP route:
config iproute add 10.1.8.x/24 10.1.10.1
Example: Configure default IP route
config iproute add default 10.1.1.1

-Performing OSPF Operations
The following commands are commonly used for performing OSFP operations.
• To set the OSPF routerid, OSPF must be disabled before you perform these steps:

a Configure the OSPF router ID:
config ospf routerid router id
config ospf routerid 1.1.1.1

b Enable OSPF:
enable ospf
• To create an OSPF area:
create ospf area area id
• To set the OSPF priority:
config ospf [vlan] vlan name priority 0-255
The range is 0 through 255, higher numbers win. The default setting is 1. Setting the value to 0
ensures that the router is never selected as the designated router (DR) or backup designated router
(BDR).
Note
You need a full core license to change the OSPF priority. An edge license does not
support OSPF and an advanced-edge license is only priority 0.


=IP Routing

• To turn on OSPF for a VLAN, perform these steps:
a Configure the OSPF for a specific VLAN:
config ospf add Data area 0.0.0.0
b Enable OSPF:
enable ospf
• To turn off OSPF for a VLAN:
config ospf delete Data
• To see the status of OSPF:
show ospf
• To look at the ODPF neighbors:
show ospf neighbor
• To look at the OSPF LSDB:
show ospf lsdb

= Configuring VRRP
If the virtual IP address is the same as a VLAN IP address, the switch will preempt and become the
VRRP master for that VRID, regardless of the priority settings.
• To configure a VRRP, follow these steps:
a Create a VRRP:
create vrrp Data vrid 1
create vrrp vlan Voice vrid 2
b Configure the VRRP:
config vrrp Data vrid 1 add 10.1.10.1
config vrrp Voice vrid 2 add 2 10.1.20.1
c Enable the VRRP:
enable vrrp
• To view the VRRP configuration:
show config vrrp
• To view what is actually happening on the VRRP:
show vrrp
Turning On SNTP
1 Configure the primary SNTP:
config sntp primary x.x.x.x vr vr-def
2 Configure the secondary SNTP:
config sntp secondary x.x.x.x vr vr-def
3 Enable the SNTP client:
enable sntp-client

- IP Routing
Examples:
configure timezone name EST -300 autodst name EDT
configure timezone name CST -360 autodst name CDT
configure timzone name MST -420 autodst name MDT
configure timzone name PST -480 autodst name PDT

-Enabling Web Access
To enable web access:
enable web http

-Configuring SNMP
To configure SNMP, follow the syntax of these examples:
Example: Read-only
configure snmp add community readonly new_ro
Example: Read-write
configure snmp add community readwrite new_rw
Example: Configure system name
config snmp sysname new name
Note
This command will change the CLI prompt to match.

== Advanced Configuration Examples

= Configuring EAPS

Turning on a DHCP Server on a Test VLAN
Managing BootP Relay
Mirroring (Span Port)

Configuring EAPS
To configure EAPS, follow the syntax of this example:

# assume that the Data and Voice vlans already exist
config Data add ports 49,50 tagged
config Voice add ports 49,50 tagged
create vlan EAPS-Control
config EAPS-Control tag 1000
config EAPS-Control qosprofile qp8
config EAPS-Control add port 49-50 tag
# the VLAN that controls EAPS never ever gets an IP address. Ever.
# the VLAN that controls EAPS never ever has user ports added to it. Ever.

create eaps EAPS-Ring
config EAPS-Ring mode master
# config EAPS-Ring mode transit
* Only one node on the ring is setup as Master, all others are Transit.
config EAPS-Ring primary port 49
config EAPS-Ring secondary port 50
config EAPS-Ring add control EAPS-Control
config EAPS-Ring add protect Data
config EAPS-Ring add protect Voice
enable eaps
enable eaps EAPS-Ring

Turning on a DHCP Server on a Test VLAN
To turn on a DHCP server on a test VLAN, follow the syntax of this example:
configure vlan test ipaddress 10.1.10.1/24
configure vlan test dhcp-address-range 10.1.10.100 – 10.1.10.150
configure vlan test dhcp-options default-gateway 10.1.10.1
enable dhcp port 1:1-1:12 vlan test

Note
The DHCP server is not intended for production use. It only supports a couple of options and
it will not handle a heavy load.

Managing BootP Relay
To manage BootP Relay, follow the syntax of these examples:
# enable bootprelay for every VLAN
enable bootprelay
#or just for the upstream and downstream VLANs
enable bootprelay vlan data
enable bootprelay vlan backbone
#either way, add the IP address of the DHCP server
config bootprelay add 10.1.30.254
To disable BOOTP Relay on one or more VLANs:
disable bootprelay vlan data
To see the BOOTP Relay configuration and statistics:
show bootprelay

Mirroring (Span Port)
Up to 128 mirroring filters can be configured with the restriction that a maximum of 16 of these can be
configured as VLAN and/or virtual port (port + VLAN) filters.
One monitor port or 1 monitor port list can be configured. A monitor port list may contain up to 16
ports.
To mirror (span port), follow the syntax of these examples:
Example: Mirror all traffic received at 6:5 to the monitor port 3:4
enable mirroring to port 3:4
configure mirroring add port 6:5 ingress
Example: Mirror all traffic received at port 5 to the monitor port 22
enable mirroring to port 22
configure mirroring add port 5 egress
Example: Mirror all traffic received on VLAN red to the monitor port 4
enable mirroring to port 4
configure mirroring add vlan red

Advanced Configuration Examples

Example: Mirror all traffic received on VLAN red, port 5 to the monitor
port 4
enable mirroring to port 4
configure mirroring add vlan red port 5
Example: Mirror all traffic received at port 6:5 to the monitor ports
2:5-2:7
enable mirroring to port-list 2:5-2:7 loopback-port 3:1
configure mirroring add port 6:5 ingress
Note
Port 3:1 is the loopback port (otherwise unused). A loopback port is required when doing
1:many mirroring.
Example: Turn off mirroring
disable mirroring
















Note
The no-refresh option is not supported with this command.I reached out to Extreme regarding their documentation (I work for a partner), and it turns out they already have an EXOS cheat sheet, so my channel SE sent it over.  I was not able to find this document anywhere on Extreme's site.  However, an Extreme SE confirmed this document is public, so here it is:  EXOS Quick Guide - Cheat Sheet.  I may still update this page on occasion, but Extreme's document is more complete.
