- intro : -
by default, the security of NETCONF protocol is guarenteed by:
the SSH protocol 
NETCONF relies on standardized protocols, especially on SSH to encapsulate the NETCONF session

NETCONF defines
 the primitives used to configure the network devices 
The data format is defined by YANG and used in the NETCONF operations then.

a YANG data model defines:
the format of data handled by the NETCONF protocol

the NETCONF server capabilities are:
 the configuration functionnalities offered by the server the configuration functionnalities offered by the server - correct
The capabilities announced by the server are the functionnalites it offers regarding what configuration operations can be applied. They are independent of the client capabilities and both of the server and client announces them in an asynchronous manner.

in tree structure defined with YANG, what are the possible types of internal nodes? 
 container 
list
A leaf-list is actually a leaf containing several elements but without hierachy.

a container specified as "presence" is a configuration value which must be specified when configuring the device: false 
"presence means that this container has a semantic meaning by its own presence only (has a configuration semantic). It can be empty and differs from the keyword "mandatory".

is it possible to define your own type for configuration data? yes
