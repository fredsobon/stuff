# dlarquey , 30/11/2011 :	Hostname completion for the DNS name resolution at E-Merchant platforms
###

#
# * Description:
#
# This bash completion script calls "dns_search" tool in the aim of using bash completion for all our favorite network commands (ssh,scp,ping,traceroute and others)
#
# * Requirements:
#
# dns_search : internal name lookups for both historical and NG platforms
#
# * Install:
#
# - Add this file in /etc/bash_completion.d directory with adapted owner rights (644)
# - Specify in this script the full path of the "dns_search" search script or add it into /usr/local/bin
# - "dns_search" needs to have DNS_SVN_PATH environment set to point to local repository of DNS zone files

# The method used is to redirect "_known_hosts_real" function. This function is used for hostname completion by network commands like ssh,scp,rsync,ping,traceroute and others

_pix_dns_hosts() {
	local cur prev hosts

	#_get_comp_words_by_ref -n : cur prev
	cur="${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}"
	prev="${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD-1]}"

# dns_search
	[ -x $(which dns_search >/dev/null) ] && hosts=( $($(which dns_search) --hostonly --nameonly ^$cur |xargs) )
	COMPREPLY=( $(compgen -W '${COMPREPLY[@]} ${hosts[@]}' -- "$cur") )
	return 0
}


if ! declare -f _pix_old_known_hosts_real >/dev/null; then
	[ ! -x $(which dns_search >/dev/null) ] && { echo "WARNING: dns_search is missing for bash completion (e-merchant DNS lookups)" >&2; return 1; }

	eval "$(declare -f _known_hosts_real|sed s@_known_hosts_real[[:blank:]]*\(\)@_pix_old_known_hosts_real\(\)@)"

	_known_hosts_real() {
		_pix_old_known_hosts_real "$@"
