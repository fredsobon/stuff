# This script is used to do a safe restart of Apache/PHP FPM on all real WEB servers one by one sequentially.
# It must be run from the staging server only. (the root ssh key of the staging server is provided all over the cluster)
# for each real server, it runs remote script: /usr/local/e-merchant/bin/apache-php-FPM_safe_restart.sh who is in charge of restarting services safely

# If an error occured on remote script, then the treatment is canceled and an email requesting checks is sent.
