HP 3PAR CRC errors in correlation with Brocade SAN

HP 3PAR CRC errors and Invalid transmission word in correlation with Brocade SAN switches
The advantage of HP 3PAR is hidden in monitoring mechanism. One of them is especially useful in case we do not have any special monitoring within our SAN. Thanks to that, we have opportunity to detect possible issue, before it will affect substantially our environment.

Intermittent CRC Errors Detected

Let’s take a look how HP 3PAR can present such an information to us. First example comes from HP 3PAR Service Processor Onsite Customer Care (SPOCC).

Event type: evt_host_port_crc_errors			     
ID: 30003
Component: Port 3:1:3
Short Dsc: Host Port 3:1:3 experienced over 50 CRC errors (50) in 24 hours Event String: Host Port 3:1:3 experienced over 50 CRC errors (50) in 24 hours
...
Event String: Port 3:1:3 Degraded (Intermittent CRC Errors Detected {0x2})
Same thing can be checked on HP 3PAR system itself. Just look at the event log.

Next step lead us to deeper investigation on the presented issue.

Fibre Channel Link Error Status Block (LESB) on HP 3PAR

HP 3PAR offers LESB which stands for Link Error Status Block and this functionality is preserved for Fibre Channel. It gives six counters with fundamental checks of errors in terms of connectivity and its quality.

First do a check on all hosts within system for recognition of host that could be responsible for generated errors. Command showhost with -lesb option gives us necessary information.

As shown above (of course output is truncated to things that have matter for this article) one host is tricky, moreover only one SFP/HBA of this host could be consider as problematic. Also we can note that storage ports are the same to those one reported by 3PAR system.

Let’s go deeper and make sure that hostdb_1 is the issue, not the storage port. It is time to check storage ports and hosts that are logged under them. First ..

.. and the second one.

The above output should show many hosts (depends on your configuration). As it was proved counters indicates on a specific WWPN of host.

Brocade SAN investigation on CRC errors

This is the time to look at the fabric. At this point we have knowledge that issue should not be caused by invalid storage port, as counters related to specific storage ports are clean. But to leave nothing to chance, we also check storage ports within fabric.

Brocade SAN investigation – searching for WWPNs on fabric

Brocade SAN investigation – error counters in practice

Start with the ports, where investigated storage ports are connected. Check them using below commands.

portstatsshow
porterrshow
portshow
If some counters appear to be in abnormal values, check them, however related to CRC errors could be also visible at this level. Other errors are not the subject of this article. Also to be sure that problem has continuous character, clear the counters on all investigated ports and give them time to show you how bad they are.

Time to look on port where host was attached.

From above we can see two questionable counters:

er_enc_out
er_bad_os
With errors visible on 3PAR it is also possible to see on switch port increased values on counters related to bad transmitted frames, especially described as CRC.

Another useful output can be generated using porterrshow command.

Now let’s take a look at counters visible under portshow command.

CMI_bus_err:       0
Above output gives us very precious clues on the nature of our issue. But before any conclusions, do the check of SFP.

Look at electrical parameters and Rx/Tx power, whether values are within acceptable frames. As we can see, in this case, those characteristics are just fine.

Brocade SAN investigation – final thoughts on CRC errors

The investigation we did lead us finally to some conclusions, which I am more than happy to present here.

First signs of disease that is sweeping our optical veins are errors related to encoding and invalid ordered set.

er_enc_out              8493        Encoding error outside of frames
er_bad_os               1046        Invalid ordered set
First value er_enc_out represents encoding error outside of frames. This counter is mostly connected to physical issues and if other counters on switch port related to CRC are not growing, it suggests problem with optical cable.

Second counter er_bad_os stands for invalid ordered set. What is ordered set? In simple words this is four byte transmission word (the smallest transmission unit defined in FC) that contains data and special character. Ordered sets are able to obtain bit and word synchronization. An ordered set is always begin with special character K28.5.

One of the most recognized Ordered Sets:

Start-of-Frame (SOF) and End-of-Frame (EOF) as frame delimiters.
Primitive signals (IDLE/ARBff and R_RDY), which are responsible for basic flow control.
Primitive sequence which is transmitted continuously. This sequence of ordered sets gives detection and visibility on port state and its behavior.
» Offline state (OLS) indicates that port is beginning link initialization protocol, or received and recognized the NOS protocol or in the worst case scenario went in offline state.
» Not operational (NOS) is transmitted when transmitting port is detecting link failure. It also can marked offline port, where waiting for OLS sequence.
» Link reset (LR) for the purpose of initiate link reset.
» Link reset response (LRR) for confirmation of LR.
Conclusion: Ordered Sets that are coming to investigated port is broken. Most of the Ordered Sets are IDLE/ARBff. It happen that some of them could not be processed, but it will not cause any issue. But, and there is always a but, many wrong ordered sets in a row can cause issue including loss of sync, and basically means that we are loosing connectivity.

Our hunch should lead us to hardware related issue, whether with cable or with HBA. But this is not the end, and time to move on with investigation another counters that come from portshow.

2_parity_err:      0          Ols_out:      8
CMI_bus_err:       0
Error counters from above give us final confirmation about the real face of issue. Let me explain, what can be found there.

LLi stands for low-level interface and indicates problems with physical state or primitive sequences.
Proc_rqrd – Frames delivered for embedded N_Port processing. Processing required list interrupts – number of received frames that cannot be processed by HW. Reasons can be due to invalid DID, SID, DID not in routing tables, invalid VC, class of service, etc.
Loss_of_sync – port cannot synchronize (obtain bit and word synchronization).
Loss_of_sig – port is losing signal.
All those error counters strongly suggest loss of connectivity because of faulty SFP or cable. Take a closer look on below counters.

Lr_in:        8         Ols_out:      8
Lr_out:       0         Ols_in:       0
Lr and Ols are previously explained primitive sequences. Here we have simple rule:

Pair: Lr_in and Ols_out.
Pair: Lr_out and Ols_in.
In and out stand for direction of sequence. In means that it is going to switch port, out means that transmission is initiated from switch port. In general if in above pairs we have situation that one value of parameter is significantly higher (far different from equal), then the problem is obvious. If _in is much higher than _out then issue is coming to the switch, and in opposite to this, if _out counter in pair is much higher, then the switch itself cause the issue.

In our case we have equal values in pair Lr_in and Ols_out, but still they are not zero. Link reset came several times, adding to this loss_of_sync, loss_of_sig and many invalid words, conclusion is obvious.

How can we explained it? In most cases reason lies in faulty cable. Statistically it significantly rather caused by faulty HBA (its SFP) of host. That’s it. Just replace cable, in worst case scenario – HBA, and problem will gone as with touch of magic wand.

How to reset LESB counters on HP 3PAR?

Unfortunately answer to this question is negative. Manual clearly enough tells that LESB counter among with CRC errors cannot be reset. Probably such a possibility is directly in shell, so the best way is to contact HP support.
